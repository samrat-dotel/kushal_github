A hurricane is a powerful tropical storm that forms over warm ocean waters. It is characterized by strong winds, heavy rain, and 
thunderstorms. Hurricanes can cause significant damage to coastal areas, including flooding, storm surges, and wind damage. They 
are classified into five categories based on their wind speeds, with Category 5 being the most severe. Preparation and early 
warning systems are crucial in minimizing the impact of hurricanes on communities.
