A tsunami is a series of ocean waves with extremely long wavelengths caused by large-scale disturbances such as underwater 
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. These waves can travel across entire ocean basins and cause widespread destruction 
when they reach coastal areas, posing significant risks to life and property.
